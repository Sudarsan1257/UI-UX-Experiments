# UI-UX-Experiments

# Aim:

To explore the fundamentals of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design, differentiate between UI and UX using real-world case studies, illustrate the relationship between UI and UX in modern digital product design, and demonstrate the practical use of various UI/UX design tools through hands-on application.

# Result:
The experiment helped us understand the basics of UI and UX, their differences, and how they work together in design. We studied real-life examples and used tools like Figma and Adobe XD to create simple UI/UX designs.
